LLM-Augmented Prototype Representation for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition
============================================================================

This repository supports our work on **LLM-Augmented Prototype Representation** for **Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. Our approach integrates large language models (LLMs) into prototype-based few-shot learning to enhance performance in low-resource and cross-domain settings.
