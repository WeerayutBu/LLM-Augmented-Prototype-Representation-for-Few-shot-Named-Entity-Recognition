LLM-Augmented Prototype Representation for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition
============================================================================

This repository supports our work on **LLM-Augmented Prototype Representation** for **Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-based data augmentation method and a representation learning objective from the augmented dataset for the FS-NER task. Our method aims to handle new entity types and increase inference efficiency in this setting.
